# About

**faanshu-ui** is a React ui library with easily integrated, reusable and customizable components.
Our primary goal is to create a kit that helps creators to build a variety of web applications
while maintaining design consistency, accessibility and minimal aethestics.

In 2019, we started a side project outside of work/school.
While building out the project, we wanted to turn those ui components into a dedicated design system
for our future projects and for other developers who are interested.
Even though this library is currently not fully matured, we are
continuously working on improving it.

### Why the name faanshu?
We named this library "faan shu" which means "yam" in Cantonese, which is what our mom usually calls us.
