# Theming and styling

## Set the theme of your ui with the theme provider.
Pick from faanshu-ui preset themes or customize your own palette.

## Usage
```
import { FsThemeProvider } from 'faanshu-ui'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FsThemeProvider>
      <h1>Hello from faanshu-ui!</h1>
    </FsThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

## Color variants and shades
There are 8 types of color variants we use in a theme. Each variant has 3 different shades: **main**, **light**, **dark**.
The shades light and dark are generated based on the provided main value. They can also be customized.
